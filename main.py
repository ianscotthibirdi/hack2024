Here's a summary:\n\n* **Strong Growth:** Expects 102% growth in BTR units by 2025.  Ranks second for total BTR units (active, under construction, and future).\n* **High Demand:** Currently represents  6.3% of the total rental market, with this number expected to increase.\n* **Construction & Investment:** Large share of units under construction (13,207). Institutional investors are highly active, particularly in the entry-level and move-up segments.\n* **Unit Breakdown:**\n    * Active Units: 6,378\n    * Under Construction: 13,207\n    * Future Pipeline: 6,147\n* **Key Players:** Phoenix, Atlanta, and Dallas are the top 3 markets for future BTR community growth.\n\nOverall, Dallas presents a significant opportunity for BTR investors and developers due to its strong growth potential and renter demand.\n",
