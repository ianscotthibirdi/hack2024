Developers have been successful in getting BTR projects 
approved at the municipality level by playing up this message 
and demonstrating how they can address affordability 
challenges locally.
Among top markets: 
•Boise, Colorado Springs, and Raleigh have the highest 
homeownership premiums. While rents have risen dramatically 
in these markets, home prices combined with mortgage rates 
have pushed the cost of homeownership up even more.
•The homeownership premium in Greenville, Houston, and 
Minneapolis is close to the national average at 84%, 83%, and 78%, respectively. 
•The homeownership premium is relatively low in markets like 
Chicago and Miami. We attribute this to higher 2 -bedroom 
rents in the core submarkets pulling up the average rent and 
reducing the premium.

The median age for first -time buyers has climbed to 36 years old currently . While a large share of millennials are in 
the peak homebuying years, over half in the cohort are younger than that, and there’s a wave of Gen Z renters 
behind them. Elevated interest rates, low supply, and high home prices are pushing for-sale affordability beyond the point many 
people can afford. As a result, individuals are waiting to purchase a home and remaining as renters.

Zonda’s Millennial Survey reveals that affordability will keep 
renters renting 
The top 3 reasons cited by millennials for renting all note high home prices and elevated mortgage rates 
Data source: ZondaEXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Zonda's survey of millennial renters 
reveals affordability as the primary 
driver behind their decision to rent. A significant portion (39%) are waiting for 
housing prices to decrease while 36% 
say they can't afford homeownership in general, and 32% struggle to find 
affordable options in their desired 
locations. 
Additionally, many millennials noted tha t 
they value renting as it’s more suitable to 
their life stage. Approximately 22% are 
still determining which city they want to 
permanently call home and another 18% 
are waiting to get married, which people 
have steadily waited longer to do in the 
US. 
Finally, 21% expressed their preference 
for the flexibility associated with renting 
vs. owning.
Note: we will distribute a more detailed 
article to RHO subscribers in the next few 
weeks, analyzing rental housing insights 
from our Millennial Survey.0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40%Haven’t really thought about homeownershipStudent debtIt feels like a risky investmentNo down paymentI’m waiting to get married / settle downI like renting and the flexibility that goes along with itI don’t know what city I want to settle down inI haven’t found the right home to purchaseI can’t afford in the location I likeI can’t afford in generalI’m waiting for home prices to come downWhat Is Your Main Reason For Renting?

Units CommunitiesEXECUTIVE SUMMARY
More supply is on the way 
Data source: ZondaThe demographic tailwinds of millennials and Gen 
Z fuel optimism in the space even with headwinds. Through our analysis of active, under-construction, and future projects, we forecast that BTR unit 
counts will increase by 102% through 2025, 
climbing from roughly 100K in 2023 to nearly 200K. 
Moreover, we project the roughly 900 current BTR communities to climb 69% to over 1.5K over the next two years, led by 
Phoenix , Atlanta , and 
Dallas.
While the longer -term fundamentals remain 
positive for rental housing and many units are in 
the pipeline, continued credit tightening, any 
potential economic slowdown, and/or sustained 
elevated rates could delay some of these 
projects coming to market and even result in 
some distress.
Note : BTR unit and BTR community count growth rates are based on cumulative annual completions sourced from 
Zonda’s BTR database. The data shown is a sample of approximately 200k units across 1,600 projects with 
completion dates between 2013 and 2025.    Build -to-rent unit counts are projected to double over the next two years

Higher -density townhomes will be the primary driver for the 
expansion of BTR units
All build -to-rent (BTR) product types are expected to expand over the next few years
Data source: Zonda Note : BTR unit and BTR community count growth rates are based on cumulative annual completions 
sourced from Zonda’s BTR database. The data shown is a sample of approximately 200k units across 
1,600 projects with completion dates between 2013 and 2025.    Townhomes  are projected to make up the largest share of BTR unit 
completions over the next two years, with ~41K units added, or an 
increase of 95%. Community counts are expected to climb by over 300 
to a total of just more than 700 projects, a 73% increase. The Southeast 
will lead the way in townhome construction, with Atlanta and Charlotte expected to delivery the most units followed by Phoenix and Dallas.
Conventional Single -Family will account for the second-highest increase 
in BTR unit counts through 2025, increasing by roughly 29K, a 93% 
increase. Community count is projected to increase by 52%, climbing by 
180 projects to over 500 in 2025. Texas is projected to add the most single -family units, with Dallas and Houston taking the top two spots for 
completions. 
Cottages are expected to experience the greatest overall percentage 
increase for the top 3 product types over the next two years, rising by 27K units, or 121% growth. Community counts are expected to increase by 89% or 126 projects to 267 by the end of 2025. Phoenix is a dominant 
leader for the expected completion of cottage units over the next two 
years.
High -Density Detached is projected to remain a relatively small share of 
overall project and unit counts, with the addition of nearly 3K units and 18 communities through 2025. While high-density detached growth will 
be modest to other product types, a handful of markets are driving its 
expansion, including Houston and Phoenix.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
BTR outlook remains strong despite some leveling off or modest 
pullbacks in rents and occupancy QoQ

BTR unit countThe overall BTR rent reached a record high in 2Q 
2023, climbing to nearly $2.2K, and ticked down 
slightly since. Rents troughed at roughly $1.6K 
in 2020 before steadily climbing for the past several years. Single- family rents are the 
highest at $2.3K per month followed by 
townhome rents at $2.2K.
BTR occupancy rates  have eased  over the past 
year as more competition comes to the market . 
As supply has come to market and new communities approach stabilization, the rate 
has declined slightly to more traditional 
occupancy levels. Occupancy rates peaked after the pandemic at 97.7%. They remain 
higher than Class A apartments at 93.7%.
BTR community counts continue to trend 
upward at an increasing pace. Community 
count in the latest quarter increased 85% YOY. Similar to BTR community count, unit counts have grown sharply over the past year, climbing 
85% YOY. The rate of growth has slowed 
modestly as the pool of completed units steadily 
increases. We expect this trend to continue to 
remain positive over the next two years,  doubling again by the end of 2025.
The number of BTR units currently under 
construction has climbed to 132K in 1Q 2024. We 
now track well over 100K that are in the process of being built throughout the country. With 
occupancy rates high and mortgage rates still 
well above recent lows, deman d is anticipated to 
remain strong for these future units.
The future BTR pipeline remains strong but has 
fallen to 90K units in 1Q 2024, which is in  
addition to the 132K units under construction. 
Due to the longer time horizon for thes e future 
units, there should be a steady stream of BTR 
unit deliveries over the next several years.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The long -term thesis for the SFR and BTR  housing sectors
Single -family rental and build- to-rent = A permanent asset class
Rising prices and lack of affordable housing support the 
opportunity for SFR and build-to -rent community development 
by delaying renters converting to homeownership. Mortgage 
rates remain elevated despite coming down from 23 -year highs, 
holding around 7%. Moreover, rates are expected to remain 
elevated for an extended period of time, which should make renting more appealing compared to buying as long as they 
remain higher than recent levels.
Build -to-Rent communities continue to grow rapidly in terms of 
community count, developer count, and active metro areas. We expect this sector will continue to expand with BTR rental units 
forecasted to nearly double in count by 2025 . BTR Community 
count is expected to grow by 69% over the next two years. 
Currently, more than 220K BTR homes are either under 
construction or planned over the next several years.
Demographic shifts in the US indicate a delayed conversion to 
homeownership and an aging population , both of which support 
rental housing. SFR and BTR renters span the age and lifestyle 
spectrum, from single professionals to growing families and 
downsizing empty nesters.Build -to-Rent communities are moving from conventional 
single -family product to higher density. Product types are 
becoming more diverse with the introduction of townhomes and higher-density detached homes . The increase in these 
homes will expand product offerings and increase the supply of more affordable options, which should capture a greater share of the renter market.
Traditionally for-sale homes  have steadily converted to for-
rent communities. Zonda has identified nearly 50,000 units 
across 395 communities shifting from Build-to -Sell to Build -to-
Rent  via our proprietary tracking methodology. In many 
markets, there has been an increased demand for rental properties due to factors such as changing demographics, 
affordability challenges, and lifestyle preferences.
Developers of master-planned communities are increasingly 
including built -for-rent neighborhoods within their 
communities. For example, Newland Communities' Nexton  and 
Painted Tree master plan communities offer BTR communities, seeing them as the best way to serve the needs of those not yet 
ready to buy, those who have recently relocated and want to 
“test drive” an area, and those who seek a low maintenance 
lifestyle.

Build -to-Rent townhomes and 
conventional single- family homes capture

While affordability is the ultimate concern 
in the for- sale space, rental affordability is 
also a concern. To address this , the 
market is shifting away from traditional 
single -family homes in favor of higher -
density products, such as cottages for 
those under construction and 
townhomes for future units .
Cottage Style product consistently 
accounts for roughly 20 -25% of all active, 
under -construction, and future BTR 
product.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Institutional investors have paused acquisitions, while 
smaller players gain share
Single -family rental acquisitions shift more heavily to smaller investors
Data source: Zonda; Deed transactionsSingle -family rental acquisitions by the 
largest seven investors including the 
public REITs grew through mid -year 
2022. As the market softened, these 
investors pulled back acquisitions 
from a peak of 21% of total 
transaction volume to just 3 % of SFR 
acquisitions in Q4 2023.
Acquisition activity by other large 
investors and mid- tier investors has 
remained largely consistent. Small 
investors (10 to 99 units) acquisition 
share has grown as they are presented 
more opportunity with less market competition from the largest groups.

 14EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Single -family rental : a permanent asset class that will ebb and 
flow on product acquisitions  based on market conditions 
Top 7 investors/public REIT acquisition by product segment 
Acquisition activity of the largest investors has 
declined sharply in 2023  due to higher asset prices 
and increasing capital costs. Investors have become 
more focused on value- oriented homes at lower price 
points that meet their return requirements. As a result, 
there has been a shift from move up to entry -level units 
driven by investment market focus and product type 
shifts. 
With capital costs and recent highs, investors will likely 
remain focused on more opportunistic and value-
oriented price points in more affordable markets.
Previously, SFR transaction volume took off in 2021. At 
the same time, entry -level product became less 
prevalent nationwide as home prices increased. TX, FL, 
and the Southeast markets gained SFR volume share in 
2021 and 2022.
Note : Product segments vary by market based on closing price. Entry -Level is defined as up the 40th percentile, move- up is defined as the 40th to 80th percentile, high end is defined as the 80th to 95th percentile, luxury is defined as greater than the 95th  
percentile. Top Seven/Public REITs are defined as: Progress Residential, Cerberus/FirstKey, Amherst Group, Tricon, Vinebrook Hom es, Invitation Homes, AMH.Acquisition activity has moderated significantly in 2023 and shifted from move -up to entry level

Boise shows the highest home ownership premium at 149% of

The homeownership premium in Greenville, Houston, and

Built-to-Rent Total Apartment Market Class A ApartmentsCOVIDOccupancy off peak, concessions tick down slighlty
After a boom in 2022 at almost full occupancy, BTR occupancy has now returned to equilibrium at around 94 -95%. This was expected  as more supply came online. 
The increased supply and the stabilization of many BTR communities have led to a sharper increase in concessions for these co mmu nities compared to the larger and 
more stabilized apartment market. Concessions in BTR average 5.5% compared to 5.8% for Class A apartments. BTR concessions have fluctuated in the 5% to 6% 
range for just under 2 years. The uptick in concessions compared to early 2021 is likely due to the larger number of projects  competing in the market.

MARKET TRENDS
Phoenix, Dallas, and Atlanta poised for most growth based on 
units under construction 
Top BTR Markets as a Share of the Total Rental Market
Data source: ZondaPhoenix dominates the built -for-rent space 
with nearly 35,000 units active, under 
construction, or future likely to convert. Dallas 
is a dominant #2 market, followed by Atlanta. 
Active communities account for less than 3% of 
rental market share across nearly all top BTR 
markets.
As BTR unit count is expected to double by 
2025, under construction communities’ share 
of the rental market is greater than active 
communities. 
Note : Markets with more than 3,000 total units included in the table above. The Rental Market is defined as all rental units in a CBSA. Active is defined as stabilized; Under Construction is defined as being actively built but not yet complete.; Future is d efined as

BTR still accounts for a relatively minimal percentage of overall 
rental unit completions in most markets
Even while capital markets tightened and some sentiment around the market soured, most markets 
experienced a sharp uptick in BTR completions in 2023 compared to 2022. 
Data source: Zonda; Real Page, Inc.After a surge in 2023, the BTR market 
growth rate is settling into a more 
sustainable long -term trend. The top 
15 markets, which saw a three- fold 
increase in 2023, are expected to 
experience a moderation to a growth 
rate of just over 20%. With more 
communities coming online, use of 
concessions are becoming more 
commonplace. As we move forward, 
BTR completions are projected to 
account for less than 15% of all rental 
unit construction in most markets.
Phoenix experienced a sharp uptick in 
BTR completions in 2023, accounting 
for roughly one- third of all rental 
housing completions. There is some 
concern of a near- term rental supply 
glut in the market. BTR Completions as a %

Over the past two years, Houston and 
Jacksonville’s existing SFR investor 
transactions were generally built around 2000, while Atlanta and Orlando’s 
homes purchased by investors were built 
closer to 1995. Interestingly, the median 
age of housing stock is similar in the four 
markets, at 28 years for San Antonio, 
Dallas, and Atlanta and 26 for Charlotte.
Atlanta has the largest average lot sizes 
at roughly 15,000 sq. ft., while Las Vegas 
has the smallest lots at approximately 
5,000 sq. ft.
Phoenix has the highest average 
bathroom count at nearly 2.5 while 
Indianapolis averages less than 2 
bathrooms.Existing home SFR transactions vary significantly in key home

The BTR sector is expected to grow the most relative to itself in 
Wilmington, Tucson, and Greeley
BTR Units are Forecast to More than Double by 2025; 
Community Counts Expected to Grow by + 69%
Data source: ZondaHottest Markets for Growth  by 2025The BTR sector is expected to experience growth based on various factors such as increasing demand for rental properties, changi ng preferences among consumers, and investment in 
the construction of new BTR communities. Today’s high price levels, limited for -sale supply, and elevated interest rates make pu rchasing a home out of reach for more families. BTR 
communities provide a unique alternative to homeownership. In addition, many consumers prefer the ease of renting and low mai ntenance lifestyle.
Note : BTR unit and BTR community count growth rates are based on cumulative annual completions sourced from Zonda’s BTR database.  The data shown is a sample of approximately 190k units across 1,500 projects 
with completion dates between 2013 and 2025.    571%

BTR leads construction activity in many tertiary markets relative 
to conventional apartments  
Comparison of U/C metro ranking for BTR v ersus traditional apartments
Data source: Zonda; Real Page, Inc.The ranking to the measures the amount of 
conventional or traditional apartments under 
construction versus the amount of BTR under 
construction in each metro area. The markets are ranked in the purple bars from 1st (Phoenix) to 50th 
(San Francisco) for BTR construction. The teal columns 
represent the apartment rank.
Typical conventional or traditional apartment markets 
such as New York (in the middle of the graph) have a notably higher apartment market rank compared to 
BTR. 
By contrast, markets where BTR construction rank 
exceeds conventional apartment rank, have a large 
teal spike. For example, Tucson ranks 13th in terms of BTR under construction, but 69th for apartment 
construction.MARKET TRENDS

Consumer Segmentation
Metro Lifestyle
Data source: ZondaThese consumers value the benefits and amenities 
offered in their surroundings. They prioritize the location 
of their residence and understand that it plays a vital 
role in their overall quality of life. These households are mostly non -family or single -parent households. Product 
solutions are typically townhomes that are very 
high- density SFD or duplex. The surrounding location 
serves as their amenity.

These consumers are more family -oriented or recently 
“existing family” (i.e., move -down). They value location 
but affordability, and a private yard is equally 
essential. Depending on location, product solutions include high -density detached, duplex, or garden 
towns. Local locations often reflect more diversity in 
lifestyle and ethnicity. These homes are often more 
pet-friendly.

a lifestyle that a master plan offers. The extra drive 
affords them the amenity they want and a lower -

Conversion of communities from for -sale to for -rent based on 
market dynamics 
Nearly 50,000 Units Have Shifted from Build for Sale to 
Build for Rent – Atlanta is #1Who is Purchasing BTS or BTR?
Zonda has identified nearly 50,000 units across 395 communities shifting from Built for Sale to Built for Rent. In many 
markets, there has been an increased demand for rental properties due to factors such as changing demographics, 
affordability challenges, and lifestyle preferences. This growing demand has encouraged developers to shift their focus from building homes for sale to constructing purpose -built rental units. 
Note: BTS to BTR communities are identified as initial new for -sale communities based on Platt map submissions to municipalities. During Zonda's audit of new Platt submissions and existing communities tracked, Zonda identified a use case shift from a for -sale to  a 
for-rent community. These use case shifts are identified as a conversion from BTS to BTR. Active is defined as stabilized; Under  Construction is defined as being actively built but not yet complete; Future is defined as planned or pre -planned.

SF REITS Earnings calls 4Q 2023
Performance Metric Summary
Data source: Zonda; SFR REIT filings/transcriptsIn 2023 Q4, the three primary publicly traded single -family rental REITs who own and 
manage 180,220 homes reported the following same -home results:
 96.9% same -home occupancy, compared to 97.0% last quarter and 97.2% one year 
ago
 2.2% same -home new lease rent growth, compared to 6.2% last quarter and 8.0% 
one year ago
 6.6% same -home renewal rent growth, compared to 6.8% last quarter and 8.6% one 
year ago
 $2,153 same -home average monthly rent, compared to $2,129 last quarter and 
$2,038 one year ago
 67.1% same -home NOI margins, compared to 66.0% last quarter and 67.0% one year 
ago
 23.7% same -home annualized turnover, compared to 24.2% last quarter and 22.2% 
one year agoTrends to Watch – Acquisitions and Dispositions
After acquiring 1,900 homes from Starwood in 3Q23, one of the largest acquisitions for the company 
in recent years, Invitation Homes was a net negative acquirer of single -family rental homes in 4Q23, 
returning to a position they held from 4Q22 to 2Q23. In its last quarter before agreeing to be taken 
private, TCN remained a net positive acquirer of SFR properties in 4Q23 but had its lowest volume of 
net acquisitions over the past few years.  Similarly, AMH remained a net positive acquirer of SFR homes 
in 4Q23 but also by a relatively modest volume and lower compared to 3Q23. The majority of AMH’s 
acquisitions in 4Q23 were AMH development properties, as their traditional and national builder 
acquisition channels continue to be largely on pause, primarily due to the current cost of capital.Single -Family REIT Acquisitions and Dispositions

SFR and BTR Trends and the Future of Market Research
How it Started; Where We are Today; and the Future State
Past
After the Great Recession, institutions 
purchased SFR in bulk. Once bulk sales subsided, a need arose to build (or buy from builders) to gain scale.
SFR rent growth takes off: COVID fuels 
Work from Home and introduction of Build -to-Rent community concepts.
The space contains various public and private owners/operators and “mom -
and-pop” investors.Present
Zonda has built a Census, not just a Survey to define the Rental Housing space.
This data is the only of its kind 
available in the US and drives the unique insights behind the Rental Housing Outlook.Future
Zonda will continue to expand its Census of build-to -rent communities 
both in the number of projects tracked and the metrics monitored.
Additionally, Rental Housing Outlook 
clients will have the ability to subscribe to the Enterprise platform which will allow them to actively track every BTR project we cover in an intuitive interface.
